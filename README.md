🚢 RMS Titanic Dataset Project – Overview

The Titanic dataset is based on passengers who traveled on the Titanic ship, which sank on April 15, 1912.

The dataset is commonly used for:

Data Analysis

Data Cleaning

Data Visualization

Machine Learning (Survival Prediction)

📊 Common Features in Titanic Dataset
Column	Meaning
PassengerId	Unique ID
Survived	0 = No, 1 = Yes
Pclass	Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Name	Passenger name
Sex	Male / Female
Age	Passenger age
SibSp	Siblings/Spouses aboard
Parch	Parents/Children aboard
Fare	Ticket fare
Embarked	Port of boarding
🔎 What You Might Have Done in Your Project
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Filled missing Age values

Removed null values

Converted categorical data (Male/Female → 0/1)

2️⃣ Data Analysis

Example findings:

Females survived more than males

1st class passengers had higher survival rate

Children had better survival chance

3️⃣ Visualization

Bar chart (Survival count)

Pie chart (Male vs Female survival)

Histogram (Age distribution)

4️⃣ Machine Learning (If You Did)

You might have used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest
to predict survival.

🧠 Simple Conclusion Example (For Viva or Presentation)

"From the Titanic dataset analysis, we observed that gender and passenger class played a major role in survival. Female and first-class passengers had higher survival rates compared to others."

If you want, tell me:

Did you use Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn)?

Or only analysis without ML?

Do you need a project report format?

Or viva questions and answers?

I will prepare it for you 👍
